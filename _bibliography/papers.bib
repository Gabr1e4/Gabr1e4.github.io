      abstract = {Sparse ridge regression is widely utilized in modern data analysis and machine learning. 
                  However, computing globally optimal solutions for sparse ridge regression is challenging, 
                  particularly when samples are arbitrarily given or generated under weak modeling assumptions. 
                  This paper proposes a novel cut-generation method, Screening Cut Generation (SCG), to eliminate 
                  non-optimal solutions for arbitrarily given samples. In contrast to recent safe variable screening 
                  approaches, SCG offers superior screening capability by identifying whether a specific {±1} combination 
                  of multiple features (binaries) lies in the set of optimal solutions. This identification is based on 
                  a convex relaxation solution rather than directly solving the original sparse ridge regression. Hence, 
                  the cuts generated by SCG can be applied in the pre-processing step of branch-and-bound and its variants 
                  to construct safe outer approximations of the optimal solution set. Numerical experiments are reported 
                  to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of SCG, particularly in hard real 
                  instances and synthetic instances with high dimensions, low ridge regularization parameters, or challenging modeling assumptions.},

%        abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
